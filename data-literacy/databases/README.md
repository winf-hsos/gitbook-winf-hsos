# Databases

Spreadsheets are quick and easy to use and provide a range of functionality for the average information worker. But spreadsheets hit a serious limit as soon as one or more of the following points come true:

* We need to manage information with multiple users simultaneously \(read, write, update\).
* Our data exceeds a certain volume.
* Our data model becomes complex.

That's where databases come in to save the day.
