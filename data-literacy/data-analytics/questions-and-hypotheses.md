# Questions & Hypotheses

## Open vs. closed questions

Questions you have regarding your data can be either open or closed questions. Closed questions can be answered by a simple _yes_ or _no_, or by a number. Some examples for closed questions include:

* Do we see fewer tweets on weekends? \(answer: yes / no\).
* How many tweets in our sample contain the hashtag \#covid19? \(answer: some definite number\).
* What is the percentage of tweets that deal with the corona crisis in our sample \(answer: some percentage\).
* When did we see the first tweet containing a reference to the corona crisis? \(answer: a single date\).

In contrast, open questions cannot be answered by a single number or a yes or no. Examples include:

* How did the corona crisis change the perception of Angela Merkel in the Twitter community?
* How do people on Twitter perceive the lock down measurements?
* How is the scientific community communicating about the corona crisis?
