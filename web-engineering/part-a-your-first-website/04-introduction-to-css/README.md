To get started with CSS, I recommend the MDN tutorial on CSS.

This module gets you started on the path to CSS mastery with the basics of how it works, including selectors and properties, writing CSS rules, applying CSS to HTML, how to specify length, colour, and other units in CSS, cascade and inheritance, and debugging CSS.\",\"icon\":{\"type\":\"icon\",\"url\":\"https://developer.mozilla.org/static/img/favicon144.e7e21ca263ca.png\",\"width\":144,\"height\":144,\"aspectRatio\":1},\"thumbnail\":{\"type\":\"thumbnail\",\"url\":\"https://developer.mozilla.org/static/img/opengraph-logo.72382e605ce3.png\",\"width\":600,\"height\":600,\"aspectRatio\":1}}" %}
