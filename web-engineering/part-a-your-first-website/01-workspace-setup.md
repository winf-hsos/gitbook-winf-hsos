# Workspace Setup

## CodePen

[CodePen](https://codepen.io/) is an online environment for prototyping and testing HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Since we'll be using CodePen especially during the introduction to HTML & Co., you'll need to [create a free account](https://codepen.io/accounts/signup/user/free) with CodePen.

![You can edit HTML, CSS and JavaScript directly and see the results on the right hand side.](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%285%29.png)

For a introduction on how to use CodePen, watch the following video from one of the founders.

## Cloud9

Playing around with HTML, CSS and JavaScript works great in CodePen. However, for our web projects we need a little more functionality. This is why we develop our web projects with [Cloud9](https://c9.io/login), which is an online IDE running fully in your browser. \(IDE stands for _integrated development environment_\). As the name suggest, Cloud9 is a cloud software \(like CodePen\), which means you don't need to install any software on your computer to participate in this course.

{% hint style="info" %}
We have a team on Cloud9 to which I send you an invitation during the first two weeks of class. Please wait for this invitation to sign up! If you didn't get an invitation, contact me via Slack.
{% endhint %}

In Cloud9 you can create your own workspace and access it from anyhwere \(if you are connected to the internet\). All your files will be there as you left them before. You can even share workspaces with your peers, and collaborate on your website in real time. We'll use this feature when we develop the web apps in teams.
