# Workspace Setup

## Cloud9

In this course we work with [Cloud9](https://c9.io/login), which is an online IDE running fully in your browser. \(IDE stands for _integrated development environment_\). You don't need to install any software on your computer.

{% hint style="info" %}
We have a team on Cloud9 to which I send you an invitation during the first week of class. Please wait for this invitation to sign up! If you didn't get an invitation, contact me via Slack.
{% endhint %}

In Cloud9 you can create your own workspace and access it from anyhwere \(if you are connected to the internet\). All your files will be there as you left them before. You can even share workspaces with your peers, and collaborate on your website in real time. We'll use this feature when we develop the web apps in teams.

{% hint style="info" %}
I'll soon post a short video that gives an overview of the Cloud9 environment.
