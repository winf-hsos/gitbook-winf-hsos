# Text Structure and Format

Read the following parts of the MDN tutorial ["Introduction to HTML"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML) to learn how to structure and format text with HTML:

This article should have given you a good idea of how to start marking up text in HTML, and introduced you to some of the most important elements in this area. There are a lot more semantic elements to cover in this area, and we\'ll look at a lot more in our \'More Semantic Elements\' article, later on in the course. In the next article, we\'ll be looking in detail at how to create hyperlinks, possibly the most important element on the Web.\",\"icon\":{\"type\":\"icon\",\"url\":\"https://developer.mozilla.org/static/img/favicon144.e7e21ca263ca.png\",\"width\":144,\"height\":144,\"aspectRatio\":1},\"thumbnail\":{\"type\":\"thumbnail\",\"url\":\"https://developer.mozilla.org/static/img/opengraph-logo.72382e605ce3.png\",\"width\":600,\"height\":600,\"aspectRatio\":1}}" %}

Bear in mind that what you have seen during this course is not an exhaustive list of HTML text elements â€” we wanted to try to cover the essentials, and some of the more common ones you will see in the wild, or at least might find interesting. To find way more HTML elements, you can take a look at our HTML element reference \(the Inline text semantics section would be a great place to start.\) In the next article we will look at the HTML elements you\'d use to structure the different parts of an HTML document.\",\"icon\":{\"type\":\"icon\",\"url\":\"https://developer.mozilla.org/static/img/favicon144.e7e21ca263ca.png\",\"width\":144,\"height\":144,\"aspectRatio\":1},\"thumbnail\":{\"type\":\"thumbnail\",\"url\":\"https://developer.mozilla.org/static/img/opengraph-logo.72382e605ce3.png\",\"width\":600,\"height\":600,\"aspectRatio\":1}}" %}
