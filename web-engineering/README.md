## Learning Objectives

In this course, you are going to learn how to build modern web applications.

### What you'll know

After completing this course, you'll understand the following concepts:

* How modern websites and web applications work and how you can build one yourself.
* What HTML, CSS and Javascript are and the role they play in modern web applications.
* Which tools and platforms simplify web development.

### What you'll be able to do

* Write basic websites with HTML, CSS and JavaScript
* Plan and implement your own web application \(at least a prototype\)
* Write Javascript code and use APIs to integrate cloud services like Google Maps into your web application
* Understand what it takes to build a sophisticated web application \(and talk with IT people about it\)

## Concept

The course is divided into three main parts.

The course's primary focus is on your own web project, which you are going to plan and implement in a group of four fellow students. To be able to build a web app, you first need to learn the basics of websites. This what **part A** of this course is about.

In **part B**, you start building your own web app in groups of 4. We'll start with basic components every modern web app needs: hosting, user authentication, a database, and way to store user content. We'll use Google Firebase as our infrastructure.

{% page-ref page="part-b-web-app-project/" %}

In **part C**, you further enhance your web app individually \(still in groups, but probably unique features\). You'll build on what you learned in part A and B to implement exciting features.

## Examination

Unlike most courses, this course does **not** end in a 2 hour written exam. We do all all necessary work to complete this course during the semester:

* Planning and building you own web application \(70%\)
* Mastering 2 short and mostly multiple choice tests after weel 6 and 12 \(30%\)

## Level

This is an introductory course, there are no prerequisites to enrol. You can certainly benefit from having basic programming skills, but it's not required.

## Software & Accounts

### CodePen

We are using [Codepen](https://codepen.io) to illustrate HTML, CSS and Javascript concepts and quickly try out things in the classroom. You can only save your work when you sign-up for CodePen, so it is required you create a free account.

### Cloud9 IDE

[Cloud9](https://c9.io) an an online IDE \(integrated development environemt\), which is basically a code editor with some advanced features. One great thing about it is that you don't have to install any software on your own computer. All you need is a modern browser such as Chrome, Firefox or Safari. Another great features is that you can share a common workspace for all your team members and work simultaneously on your project. For this course, everyone needs their own free Cloud9 account.

### Google Firebase

[Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) is a cloud platform for web development. It offers a variety of functionality for our web projects. Among those is hosting, user authentication, storage and a document database. For this course, at least one group member must sign up and create a Firebase project. All other members can then join this project if they have a Google account.

Using Firebase for our purposes is free, as long as we don't exceed the generous free quotas.
