## 🔑 Key Points

🔑 A program is a series of commands that, when the program is run, the computer executes in the prescribed order.

🔑 Javascript is a modern and popular programming language. Javascript originates from web applications, where it is still most widely used. It runs in the background of every browser when you open a web page. However, in recent years, a server-side version of Javascript called 🏷Node.js conquered the developer world. Node.js programs can run anywhere, not just in a browser. For example, we can run Node.js on a small computer such as the 🏷Raspberry Pi, which makes it a great programming language for 🏷Internet of Things \(IoT\) applications.

🔑 There are some concept that you'll find in almost any programming language. Mastering these concepts is the key to algorithmic thinking: 

* Variables
* IF-THEN-ELSE statements \(or control  structures\)
* Loops 
* Objects
* Properties
* Functions
