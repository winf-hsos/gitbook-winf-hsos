## Coding is not witchcraft

Now that we know how a computer works in general, we know that the only thing a computer does is change the values of bits from 1 to 0 \(or vice versa\) and store them. All the seemingly complex things we can do with a computer today are simply a lot \(!\) of zeroes and ones being stored, read and changed.

The computer uses a set of predefined operations to read, change and store bits. These operations are also _machine code_ _instructions_. A list of such instructions is called a _program_, and if the program is written in machine code, it can be directly executed by the _central processing unit_ \(CPU\). Writing machine code is the lowest form of programming, and it requires specific knowledge about the hardware components \(CPU, memory, peripheral devices\). Because of the high complexity, very few people write programs in machine code today.

The majority of programmers today write their code in a so called _higher level programming language_ \(as opposed to machine code, which is the lowest possible level\). They are much more convenient to use, because they hide the complexity of the hardware, and instead rely on more abstract layers such as the operating system to handle the communication with hardware devices.
