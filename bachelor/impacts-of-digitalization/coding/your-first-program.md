# Jumping in at the Deep End

## â–¶ Lesson

### 1âƒ£ First Coding Tasks

In the first block of this lesson, let's try so solve the challenge 1 from the following exercise together:

### 2âƒ£ Hardware Assembly and Test

We are now familiar with the coding environment and we have taken our first steps writing a program. That's great. But our ultimate goal is to use our coding skills to create something useful \(that's not to say that calculating the circumference of a circle isn't\).

In this block, we'll first have to introduce the hardware building blocks that we're using. There is a nice program that we can use to test our hardware to see what every device does before we try to control it programmatically. We'll also get our hands dirty and do some assembly \(drive in some screws and connect some wires\). 

Then we're ready to code!

### 3âƒ£ LEDs and Buttons

Now that we have setup and tested our hardware, we can start writing programs to control our devices. In the next challenge 2 of the exercise, we'll use the LED and the button and make them work together.
