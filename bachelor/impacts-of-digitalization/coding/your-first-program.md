# Jumping in at the Deep End

## ‚ñ∂ Lesson

### 1‚É£ Preparation

For this lesson and the exercise we're going to do, I provide a template project via Github. The template contains everything we need for this exercise. If you have installed Git on your computer, getting the template is as easy as:

```text
git clone https://github.com/winf-hsos/iodi-coding.git
```

I also provide the following tutorial on working with Tinkerforge devices. It includes a description of how to get and use the template:

### 2‚É£ First Coding Tasks

In the first block of this lesson, let's try so solve the challenge 1 from the following exercise together:

### 3‚É£ Hardware Assembly and Test

We are now familiar with the coding environment and we have taken our first steps writing a program. That's great. But our ultimate goal is to use our coding skills to create something useful \(that's not to say that calculating the circumference of a circle isn't\).

In this block, we'll first have to introduce the hardware building blocks that we're using. There is a nice program that we can use to test our hardware to see what every device does before we try to control it programmatically. We'll also get our hands dirty and do some assembly \(drive in some screws and connect some wires\). 

Then we're ready to code!

### 4‚É£ LEDs and Buttons

Now that we have setup and tested our hardware, we can start writing programs to control our devices. In the next challenge 2 of the exercise, we'll use the LED and the button and make them work together.

### ‚è≠ Outlook \(‚è≤5 Min.\)

Ok, that was a lot new stuff. But don't worry, it is totally normal that you feel overwhelmed and maybe didn't understand every little bit we did. But that was intentional: It is often a good idea to get your hands onto something before you talk about it in general. That's what we'll do in the next lesson.
