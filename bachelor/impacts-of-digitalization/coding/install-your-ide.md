# Setup your IDE

## üéØ Learning Objectives

* üéØ You know what pieces of software you need in order to start coding.
* üéØ You have successfully setup your workspace and are ready to go!

## ‚ñ∂ Lesson

### 1‚É£ Install Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is a popular code editor created by Microsoft. Visual Studio Code is open source and free to use. To work on the upcoming tasks, you'll need to install Visual Studio Code on your computer üë©üíª. Follow these steps:

* ‚úÖ Download ‚¨á Visual Studio Code from [the official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It should recognize your operating system \(Windows, MacOS etc.\) automatically and provide you with the right version. 
* ‚úÖ Locate the file on your computer and run the installation üèÉ‚ôÇ  
* ‚úÖ After the installation has finished, open Visual Studio Code and see if it works correctly.

### 2‚É£ Install VS Live Share Extension

Visual Studio Code has a nice feature for working in teams. You can share your editor content with anyone and allow your team members to collaborate in real-time. This makes group programming much more productive. It also gives me the opportunity to support you when needed.

To use the sharing feature, we have to install an extension called _VS Live Share_. Follow these steps:

* ‚úÖ Open Visual Studio Code and click on the extensions tab. 
* ‚úÖ In the search field, type "VS Live Share". The extension "VS Live Share" should appear as the first item in the results list. 
* ‚úÖ Click on the list entry, you should see the details of the extension in your editor pane. Below the title, there should be a small green button labeled "Install". Click it!

### 3‚É£ Install Node.js

To run Javascript programs on your local computer, you'll need to install the Node.js runtime. Follow these steps:

* ‚úÖ Download ‚¨á the installation file from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/en/). Choose the LTS version \(left side\) for your operating system. 
* ‚úÖ Locate the file on your computer and run the installation üèÉ‚ôÇDuring the installation, make sure you accept all default settings. 
* ‚úÖ Verify that Node.js was installed successfully. Open Visual Studio Code, open a terminal \(View --&gt; Terminal\), and type `node --version`. The result should be the version number you just installed.

### 4‚É£ Install Git

Git is a popular source control system. This means that you can save your code in a centralized Git repository to back it up and provide the latest version to your team members. [Github](https://github.com/winf-hsos) is a popular online platform for hosting Git projects, and the great thing is that you can simply clone public code repositories and start using them in your own coding projects. We'll be using Git to do that later on.

* ‚úÖ Follow [this link](https://gist.github.com/derhuerst/1b15ff4652a867391f03) for installation instructions for all operating systems

### 5‚É£ Install Tinkerforge Brick Viewer and Daemon

In this module, we are using hardware devices from a company called [Tinkerforge](https://www.tinkerforge.com/en/). The company offers a small software that allows us to quickly try out the different sensors and other devices without the need to write a program ourselves. We'll use this software to get familiar with the different devices before we decide to use them in our programs. 

* ‚úÖ Follow these links to install the Brick Daemon on your computer. The Brick Daemon is a necessary service for the Brick Viewer: 
  * [Brick Daemon for Windows](http://download.tinkerforge.com/tools/brickd/windows/brickd_windows_2_3_2.exe)
  * [Brick Daemon for Mac OS](http://download.tinkerforge.com/tools/brickd/macos/brickd_macos_2_3_2.dmg) 
* ‚úÖ Now that you have installed the Brick Daemon, you can install the Brick Viewer: 
  * [Brick Viewer for Windows](http://download.tinkerforge.com/tools/brickv/windows/brickv_windows_2_3_17.exe)
  * [Brick Viewer for Mac OS](http://download.tinkerforge.com/tools/brickv/macos/brickv_macos_2_3_17.dmg)

Congratulations, you have made it! We're now ready to work!
