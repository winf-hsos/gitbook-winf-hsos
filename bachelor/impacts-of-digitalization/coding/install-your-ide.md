# Setup your IDE

## ▶ Session

### 1⃣ Install Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is a popular code editor created by Microsoft. Visual Studio Code is open source and free to use. To work on the upcoming tasks, you'll need to install Visual Studio Code on your computer 👩💻. Follow these steps:

* ✅ Download ⬇ Visual Studio Code from [the official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It should recognize your operating system \(Windows, MacOS etc.\) automatically and provide you with the right version. 
* ✅ Locate the file on your computer and run the installation 🏃♂  
* ✅ After the installation has finished, open Visual Studio Code and see if it works correctly.

### 2⃣ Install VS Live Share Extension

Visual Studio Code has a nice feature for working in teams. You can share your editor content with anyone and allow your team members to collaborate in real-time. This makes group programming much more productive. It also gives me the opportunity to support you when needed.

To use the sharing feature, we have to install an extension called _VS Live Share_. Follow these steps:

* ✅ Open Visual Studio Code and click on the extensions tab. 
* ✅ In the search field, type "VS Live Share". The extension "VS Live Share" should appear as the first item in the results list. 
* ✅ Click on the list entry, you should see the details of the extension in your editor pane. Below the title, there should be a small green button labeled "Install". Click it!

### 3⃣ Install Node.js

To run Javascript programs on your local computer, you'll need to install the Node.js runtime. Follow these steps:

* ✅ Download the installation file from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/en/). Choose the LTS version \(left side\) for your operating system. 
* ✅ Locate the file on your computer and run the installation 🏃♂During the installation, make sure you accept all default settings. 
* ✅ Verify that Node.js was installed successfully. Open Visual Studio Code, open a terminal \(View --&gt; Terminal\), and type `node --version`. The result should be the version number you just installed.
