We reserve this time slot to discuss your questions.

### ‚è≠ Outlook \(‚è≤5 Min.\)

We now know how computers represent information and how they can perform basic arithmetic and logic operations with simple logic gates. In the next session, we'll look at the differences between analog and digital and how can transform analog things into a digital representation.
