# Impacts of Digitalization

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives <a id="learning-objectives"></a>

Coming soon.

## ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡² Language

This module is part of the international program. For this reason, the language will be English. But don't worry, we'll consider all levels of English, so if you can't follow because of language barriers, we'll try to slow down and repeat. Also, if you can't say it in English, even though you tried, you can always answer in German ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª .

## ðŸ“ƒ Concept <a id="concept"></a>

This module is divided into 4 parts.

* 1âƒ£ Coding - The basics we need to work with digital technology âŒ¨ 
* 2âƒ£ Internet of Things - Devices with sensors that we can program ðŸ‘©ðŸ’» 
* 3âƒ£ Artificial Intelligence - Algorithms that make our devices smart ðŸ‘½ 
* 4âƒ£ Economic Impacts - The bigger picture of what digitalization does to our world ðŸŒŽ 

## ðŸŽš Level <a id="level"></a>

This is an introductory course, so there are no prerequisites to enroll ðŸ˜„. That said, it will help you if you have an understanding of programming ðŸ¦¸â™‚. But don't worry,  most of you won't and we'll cover everything you need in this course. The primary goal of this course is to tinker ðŸ‘¾ with technology and have fun!

## ðŸ™€ Examination <a id="examination"></a>

Unlike most courses, this one has no final written examination ðŸ¤©. Since we are building something awesome throughout the semester in groups, the group's work and result will be 70% of your grade. For the other 30% , you'll take two short MC-test during the semester, each weighing 15%.
