# Impacts of Digitalization

## 🎯 Learning Objectives <a id="learning-objectives"></a>

Coming soon.

## 🇺🇲 Language

This module is part of the international program. For this reason, the language will be English. But don't worry, we'll consider all levels of English, so if you can't follow because of language barriers, we'll try to slow down and repeat. Also, if you can't say it in English, even though you tried, you can always answer in German 🇩🇪 .

## 📃 Concept <a id="concept"></a>

This module is divided into 4 parts.

* 1⃣ Coding - The basics we need to work with digital technology ⌨ 
* 2⃣ Internet of Things - Devices with sensors that we can program 👩💻 
* 3⃣ Artificial Intelligence - Algorithms that make our devices smart 👽 
* 4⃣ Economic Impacts - The bigger picture of what digitalization does to our world 🌎 

The first part introduces basic concepts of programming. We need this to implement a prototypical product based on Internet of Things \(IoT\) devices and Machine Learning algorithms. This prototype is also the subject of the experimental work, which accounts for 70% of the final grade.

For the experimental work we rely heavily on group work. Therefore, the two weekly sessions are divided as follows:

* 🏷 Session 1: Learn new concepts and discuss the topics at hand.
* 🧪 Session 2: Maker Lab - Working in groups on the experimental prototype.

## 🎚 Level <a id="level"></a>

This is an introductory course, so there are no prerequisites to enroll 😄. That said, it will help you if you have an understanding of programming 🦸♂. But don't worry,  most of you won't and we'll cover everything you need in this course. The primary goal of this course is to tinker 👾 with technology and have fun!

## 🙀 Examination <a id="examination"></a>

Unlike most courses, this one has no final written examination 🤩. Since we are building something awesome throughout the semester in groups, the group's work and result will be 70% of your grade. For the other 30% , you'll take two short MC-test during the semester, each weighing 15%.

## 👩💻 Software & Accounts <a id="software-and-accounts"></a>

You need the following tools 🛠 and accounts. All tools are free of charge:

* [Github Account](https://github.com/join)
