# Workspace Setup

### Download and install Tableau Desktop for Students

Download the latest version of Tableau Desktop via [this link](https://www.tableau.com/tft/activation). On the form, enter your university email address for _Business E-mail_ and enter "**University of Applied Science Osnabrueck**" for _Organization._ Install Tableau and start it. When you're asked for a license key, enter the one that I provided via Slack.
