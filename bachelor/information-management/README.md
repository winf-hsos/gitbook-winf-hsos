## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives <a id="learning-objectives"></a>

Coming soon.

## ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡² Language

This module is part of the international program. For this reason, the language will be English. But don't worry, we'll consider all levels of English, so if you can't follow because of language barriers, we'll try to slow down and repeat. Also, if you can't say it in English, even though you tried, you can always answer in German ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª.

## ðŸ“ƒ Concept <a id="concept"></a>

This module is divided into 3 parts. For each, there will be a separate part of the case study that you're going to solve in groups:

* 1âƒ£ Spreadsheets - Manage data in Excel or Google Sheets
* 2âƒ£ SQL - Swiss army knife for all your data needs
* 3âƒ£ Tableau - Visualize your results and tell stories with data

## ðŸŽš Level <a id="level"></a>

This is an introductory course, so there are no prerequisites to enroll ðŸ˜„. It'll be helpful if have worked with Excel or even SQL before, but I don't expect anything.

## ðŸ™€ Examination <a id="examination"></a>

Unlike most courses, this one has no final written examination ðŸ¤©. We are working on practical case studies during the semester. The result of those accounts for 70% of your grade. For the other 30% , you'll take two short MC-test during the semester, each weighing 15%.

## ðŸ‘©ðŸ’» Software & Accounts <a id="software-and-accounts"></a>

You need the following tools ðŸ›  and accounts. All tools are free of charge:

* Microsoft Excel or Google Spreadsheets
* Databricks
* Tableau Desktop
