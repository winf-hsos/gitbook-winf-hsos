# Workspace Setup

## Glitch

We develop our web projects with [Glitch](https://glitch.me), which is an online code editor running fully in your browser. Glitch is a cloud software, which means you don't have to install anything on your computer to participate in this course.

In Glitch, you can create your own projects and access the code from anywhere \(if you are connected to the internet\). All your files will be there as you left them before. You can even share projects with your peers and collaborate on your website in real time. We'll use this feature when we develop the web apps in teams.
