# Workspace Setup

## CodePen

[CodePen](https://codepen.io/) is an online environment for prototyping and testing HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Since we'll be using CodePen especially during the introduction to HTML & Co., you'll need to [create a free account](https://codepen.io/accounts/signup/user/free) with CodePen.

![You can edit HTML, CSS and JavaScript directly and see the results on the right hand side.](../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%287%29.png)

For a introduction on how to use CodePen, watch the following video from one of the founders.

## Glitch

Playing around with HTML, CSS and JavaScript works great in CodePen. However, for our web projects we need a little more functionality. This is why we develop our web projects with [Glitch](https://glitch.me), which is an online IDE running fully in your browser. \(IDE stands for _integrated development environment_\). Glitch is a cloud software \(like CodePen\), which means you don't need to install anything on your computer to participate in this course.

In Glitch, you can create your own projects and access the code from anywhere \(if you are connected to the internet\). All your files will be there as you left them before. You can even share projects with your peers and collaborate on your website in real time. We'll use this feature when we develop the web apps in teams.
