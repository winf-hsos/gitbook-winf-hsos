## Learning Objectives

## Concept

A practical and challenging case study is the focus of this module. You're provided with a real and quite complex data set and you must generate different insights from this data set using analytics. The case study is divided into 5 phases, which you can complete independently from each other.

In the the **first phase**, your group warms up with the exploration of the data set.

In the **second phase**, your group must dig deeper into the data using SQL to answer questions regarding the past. These are typical reporting questions about sales, turnover, profit and so forth. The main question governing this phase is _"What happened?"_

{% page-ref page="phase-2-retrospective.md" %}

In the **third phase**, you are asking the question _"Why did it happen?"_. For this, you are given hypotheses that you ought to prove using the data and some statistical tests.

{% page-ref page="phase-3-hypotheses.md" %}

In the the fourth phase, you're going to learn about how to predict certain things from the existing data. Machine learning is at the center of this phase.

The case study concludes with a short presentation, in which you aggregate your findings to establish arguments for or against a certain question at hand.

## Level

This course has no strict prerequisites, so anyone can enrol. However, having successfully passed the module [Information Management](../information-management/) gives you an advantage, as some concepts such as SQL are already covered there.

## Examination

Unlike most courses, this course does **not** end in a 2 hour written exam. We do all all necessary work to complete this course during the semester:

* Solving the five phase case study in groups, including a short final presentation \(70%\)
* Mastering 2 short multiple choice tests in the middle and at the end of the semester \(30%\)

## Software & Accounts

For this course, you'll need to create the following accounts and install the listed software below.

Thanks for the feedback. In summer 2018 we just started having a script at all. I have since improved on that and hope that this becomes less of an issue.
