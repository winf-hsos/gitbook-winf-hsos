# Codes

> Bytes are dumb. They just contain patterns of ons and offs. If a byte contains 0100 0101, and you send it to the printer, it will print the letter â€˜E.â€™ If you send it to the Instruction Register, the computer will execute a Jump instruction. If you send it to the Memory Address Register, it will select byte number 69 of the RAM. If you send it to one side of the Adder, it will add 69 to whatever is on the other side of the Adder. If you send it to the display screen, it will set three pixels on and five pixels off.
