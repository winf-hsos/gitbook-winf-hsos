# Getting to know the IDE

{% hint style="success" %}
For this tutorial, I am assuming that you use [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/). All descriptions and screenshots will be made for and from this environment.

## The Dashboard

The dashboard is the place to get an overview of your PythonAnywhere \(PA\) account and activities. Below is a screenshot of my dashboard.

The dashboard is divided into 4 different sections. In the screenshot, I highlighted the "Files" section, which is the most important section for us in this tutorial. By default, you will see your recently edited files, as well as two buttons to open an \(or create\) another file and to browse all existing files.
