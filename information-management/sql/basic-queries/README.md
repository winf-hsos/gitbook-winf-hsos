# Basic Queries

## Summary

SQL is the standard language to query database. In this section, we introduce the select command and see how we can use it to get the right columns and rows from a table.

For motivation and intro, watch this short video from the Khan Academy online course ["Intro to SQL: Querying and Managing Data"](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql):
