## Learning Objectives

In this course you are going to acquire knowledge and skills on how to handle data and information and how to derive value from data. 

### What you'll know

After completing this course, you'll know about and understand the following concepts:

* The difference between data, information, and knowledge
* What structured and semi-structured data is
* What a database is and which types of databases exist

### What you'll be able to do

After completing this course, you will be able to:

* Load data from an IT system's database to analyze it offline
* Explore and analyze previosuly unknown data sets
* Transform raw data for your needs
* Connect to a real-time data source and analyze a stream of data
* Apply tools and methods to work with semi-structured data \(Big Data\)

## Concept

The course centers around today's key use cases for information management. These key use cases are presented as challenges, which must be solved in small groups throughout the semester.

The **first case** describes a very common situation: You are getting a new and unknown data set in some file format. Sometime you asked for it, sometimes you didn't. In either case, you want to find out what the data holds for you. But how do you most efficiently do that?

{% page-ref page="challenge-1-explore-new-dataset/" %}

The **second case** is also quite common for a business of any size: You are given access to one of the information systems' databases \(or an interface to the data\) and you can use that data to your or the company's advantage. Nice, but how?

{% page-ref page="challenge-1-sales-data-analysis/" %}

The **third case** is becoming more relevant as more and more real time data is created and the time window to generate answers gets smaller. In this case, you need to make real-time analysis on data that is  created with high but unknown frequency.

The **fourth case** resolves some mysteries around the big buzz word _Big Data,_ and we'll look what it actually means. More and more data does not have the inherent structure of an Excel spreadsheet, but we still need to analyze it as it might hold important information for us. Examples include text data such from social media or product reviews. Sounds like a challenge to me!

## Examination

Unlike most courses, this course does **not** end in a 2 hour written exam. All necessary work to complete this course is performed during the semester:

* Solving three practical challenges within groups \(70%\)
* Mastering 2 short multiple choice tests in the middle and at the end of the semester \(30%\) 

## Level

This is an introductory course, there are no prerequisites to enrol.
