## Learning Objectives

In this course you are going to acquire knowledge and skills on how to handle data and information and how to derive value from data. 

### What you'll know

After completing this course, you'll know about and understand the following concepts:

* The difference between data, information, and knowledge
* What structured and semi-structured data is
* What a database is and which types of databases exist

### What you'll be able to do

After completing this course, you will be able to:

* Load data from an IT system's database to analyze it offline
* Explore and analyze previosuly unknown data sets
* Transform raw data for your needs
* Connect to a real-time data source and analyze a stream of data
* Apply tools and methods to work with semi-structured data \(Big Data\)

## Concept

The course centers around key use cases for information management. These key use cases are presented as challenges, which must be solved in small groups throughout the semester.

The information needed to solve theses challenges can be obtained during the course. Therefore, the two weekly sessions are divided into two parts: one for the introduction of new concepts, and the second for  supervised work on the challenges. However, most of the challenge work will be done within the group outside of class.

* Solving three practical challenges within groups \(70%\)
* Mastering 2 short multiple choice tests in the middle and at the end of the semester \(30%\)
