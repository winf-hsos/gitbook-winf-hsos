# 01 - Workspace Setup

## Register with Databricks Community Edition

For this course, you need a Databricks account, which gives you access to a cloud-based environment that lets you work with data in various ways.

{% hint style="success" %}
**TASK 1:** If you don't already have an account, [sign up](https://databricks.com/try-databricks) for free for the Databricks Community Edition! Make sure to choose the **Community Edtion**, **not** the free trial version!
{% endhint %}

## Download the data set

{% hint style="success" %}
**TASK 2:** [Download](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews/version/4#) the data set and save the ZIP file to your computer!
{% endhint %}

## Open the data set with your favorite editor

One nice thing about text files is you can open them with almost any editor. Windows ships with an editor called _Notepad_, which you could use to open the data set. However, if you want more features and a better experience, I highly recommend _Notepad++_, an open source text editor. You can download and install Notepad++ [here](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.5.8.html).

Once installed, start Notepad++ and open the file containing the data set.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Depending on the file size, opening a large file in Notepad++ might take a short moment. Be aware that opening files &gt; 1 GB can be a problem, depending on how  much RAM your computer has. You can try to open files of any size, if Notepad++ cannot open them it'll notify you.
{% endhint %}

When done loading, the editor content should look like this:
