# Overview

## What is Databricks?

Databricks runs in the cloud and you can interface with Databricks using any modern web browser. I personally recommend [Chrome](https://www.google.de/chrome/). There is no need to install any desktop application. This is nice, since you can access Databricks from any computer.

However, to use Databricks you need to create a free account. Use your university's e-mail address and sign-up here.

{% hint style="info" %}
On the [sign-up page](https://databricks.com/try-databricks), make sure you click on the **Community Edition** on the right side! You do not want the free trial of the Databricks Platform.
{% endhint %}

## Workspace

When you log into Databricks you are right in your workspace. More precisely, you are presented with the landing page of your workspace. From there, you can perform many important actions right away:

* Create a new notebook
* Start a new cluster
* Upload data

On the left of the Databricks UI \(= User Interface\), you see the main navigation menu to access the different sections of the UI. The most important sections for use are _Home_ and _Workspace_, which are actually identical. Additionally, we need the _Data_ and _Cluster_ sections once in while to upload new data and start new clusters.
