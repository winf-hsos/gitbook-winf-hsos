# Databricks

## What you'll learn

In this lesson you'll get to know the Databricks cloud platform. We'll cover the basic elements of Databricks, such as the workspace, notebooks, and clusters. Knowing these elements is essential to start working with Databricks.

Next, we'll add some data to our Databricks account and learn how we can access that from a notebook.
