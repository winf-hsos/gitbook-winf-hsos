# Query the Data Set

## De facto standard for querying databases

SQL was originally developed to query relational databases. This happened in the late seventies, along with the development of the first commercial relational database systems. Even today, more than thirty years later, SQL has sustained its dominant role as the de facto standard for querying databases.

With the arrival of new types of databases, such as document oriented databases, new ways to query them were required as well. And in fact, new languages were developed for these new types of databases. However, almost all databases today are designed to still understand SQL, despite the fact that they do not adhere to the relational model. Because of SQL's ubiquity, users are so familiar with SQL that it makes great sense from an acceptance perspective to implement an interface for SQL in any database product.

If a database does not rely on the relational model, this doesn't mean the data isn't in some way structured. In fact, there is no way to query unstructured data - what would you even be querying for? Even for unstructured \(or semi-structured\) data such as images, we must project some structure \(or schema\) onto the data when we want to query it. And once we have a schema, we can use SQL.
