{% endhint %}

## 1. Explore the data set

Whenever you start working with a new dats set, it is a good idea to first get an overview. Here are some questions that can help you with that!

| \# | Question | Hint |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | What file format does the data set have? | Look at the file ending and open it in a text editor such as Notepad++ |
| 2 | Does the data set have more than one file? |  |
| 3 | What is the structure of the data set? | Is it organized in columns? If so, what columns and data types can you identify? |
| 4 | If there is more than one file, is the data in each file connected? How? |  |
| 5 | How many records does the data set contain? |  |
| 6 | What is the content of each column?  | Have a look at the distinct values of each column! Create counts or other basic statistics! |
| 7 | What is the quality of the data set and each column in particular? | Do all records have values for all columns? Are there inconsistencies among column values? |

## 2. Answer questions with SQL

{% hint style="success" %}
Before building an SQL statement, think about the two questions:

* How does a result look like that would answer the question?
* Which table and columns contain the required information?
