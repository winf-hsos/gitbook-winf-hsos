# \#00 - Student Profile

## Exercise: Student Profile

### Fill your profile

Fork this [CodePen](https://codepen.io/winf-hsos/pen/dqxzrO?editors=1000) and fill out the details of your student profile. If you have a picture of you somewhere accessible on the web, copy the URL to the picture and paste in in the `src` attribute of the `<img>` tag.

{% hint style="info" %}
If your are already signed-up for Slack, you can easily use your Slack profile picture. Open Slack in a browser, navigate to your profile and right-click on the profile picture. Now click "Examine" \(or "Untersuchen\). You'll see a new view on the right, showing the source code of the Slack application. If you clicked clicked "Untersuchen" on your profile picture, the code should be highlighted. There you should see the public URL. Copy it and paste it in your profile.
{% endhint %}

### Share your profile link

When you're done, share your profile with your peers via Slack so they all get to know you a little better. To make it nicer to look at, change the view to "Full page", copy the link from your browser, and paste it into Slack.
